Below are some resources for you to continue your learning.

* [Network Analysis with R and igraph](https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph) by [Katherine Ognyanova](https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph) is a pretty comprehensive tutorial that goes over the igraph package. The rest of her website has a lot of good resources for iGraph.
* [Using igraph for visualizations](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/teaching/css2013/handout/igraph.pdf) is a good resource for getting more out of iGraph visualizations...
* ...though most people use [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) when they're making plots for publications.
